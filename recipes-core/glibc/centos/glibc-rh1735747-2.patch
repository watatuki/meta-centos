    malloc: Fix missing accounting of top chunk in malloc_info [BZ #24026]
    
    Fixes `<total type="rest" size="..."> incorrectly showing as 0 most
    of the time.
    
    The rest value being wrong is significant because to compute the
    actual amount of memory handed out via malloc, the user must subtract
    it from <system type="current" size="...">. That result being wrong
    makes investigating memory fragmentation issues like
    <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=843478> close to
    impossible.
    
    (cherry picked from commit b6d2c4475d5abc05dd009575b90556bdd3c78ad0)
